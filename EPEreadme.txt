Page is responsive 
Progress Bar will update as you go through pages

Assumptions Made:-

Since the content for part 1 was very small i have put part with it as well so that the user can look into both the parts as he is filling it out.
I was not sure about the placement of submit button So i have placed it along the previous and next part buttons for now
Input validation and Placeholder is added only for first page 
Some the features like input validation and placeholder have been demonstrated only once and be shown to all fields once the proper specifications for messages has been provided
Since it was not provided i have demonstrated it only for one field


CheckBox and Radio Button have been pre set to one value
When submit button is clicked the form will be submitted since there is no database connected the form refreshes as of now
Clear button will clear any input on the field

Coloring Conventions used for Buttons
Disabled buttons have a color of grey
Buttons which will work have color of white

Form validation has been performed but only for  one field in page 1 [field partner number] this will check if the number is present or not 
Futher input validation can be achieved the same way
